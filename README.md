   <h1>Implementation and Visualization of LeNet5 from Scratch</h1>

   <p>
    In this project, I have implemented LeNet5 architecture from scratch, just using numpy package. To costruct LeNet5, I have
    written all kinds of required layers. Also, I used Adam Gradient Descent optimizer to update trainable parameters,
    and I used MNIST dataset from Keras. I have trained the network for few epochs to see how it works.
    </p>


   <p>
    After that, I performed the LeNet5 architecture by Keras on a large dataset on my GPU. Then, I have visualized all filters of
    its convolutional layers. Finally, I passed an image from the dataset over the network, and visualized all
    feature maps of convolutional layers.
